I've been in the information technology field for over thirteen years.
I progressed from a Help Desk position to Network Engineer, Automation Engineer, DevOps Engineer, and now Senior DevOps Engineer at Higher Logic. 

My journey has taken me through diverse environments - from managing campus IT systems at New Hope Christian College for 7 years, to working as an independent contractor, then to automation engineering at an MSP (UpTime Sciences), followed by a deep dive into Web3 technologies at PyxelChain, and now focusing on cloud infrastructure and network security at Higher Logic.

This varied experience has exposed me to many different enterprise and infrastructure designs. From small business environments to cloud-first architectures, I've had the opportunity to work with a wide variety of technologies including Cisco ASA virtual appliances, Loki/Grafana logging stacks, Python automation tools, and container orchestration.

Even now, I am constantly learning new things and striving to improve my craft. 
I genuinely enjoy assisting others in resolving their problems, and I'm always looking for ways to improve the lives of others through automation and reliable infrastructure.
