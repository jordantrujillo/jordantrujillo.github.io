I've been in the information technology field for over ten years.
I progressed from a Help Desk position to Network Engineer, Automation Engineer, and now DevOps at a Web3 startup. 
My previous experience at an MSP, exposed me to many various sorts of enterprises and infrastructure designs. 
I've mostly worked for small businesses, which has given me exposure to a variety of technologies.
Even now, I am constantly learning new things and striving to improve my craft. 
I genuinely enjoy assisting others in resolving their problems, and I'm always looking for ways to improve the lives of others through my work.
