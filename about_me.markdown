I've been in the information technology field for over ten years.
I progressed from a Help Desk position to Network Engineer, Automation Engineer, and now DevOps at a Web3 startup.
I've mostly worked for small businesses, which has given me exposure to a variety of technologies.
Even now, I am constantly learning new things and striving to improve my craft. 
I genuinely enjoy assisting others in resolving their problems, and I'm always looking for ways to improve the lives of others through my work.
