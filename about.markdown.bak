<!-- ## **About Me** -->

Welcome!
This is my portoflio site for people who want to know a bit more about what I do.

I enjoy working with different technologies and interacting with people. 
One of my favorite things to do is automate boring work for others so they can focus on what they do best.

I am currently working as a Jr. Devops Engineer and Backend Dev Role in Web3.
