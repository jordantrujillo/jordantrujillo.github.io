The old theme was the default jekyll theme. I wanted to change it to something more modern and clean. I chose the [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) theme. I like the clean look and the ability to customize it. I'm happy with the new theme and I think it gives the blog a fresh new look.
