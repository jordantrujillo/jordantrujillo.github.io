excerpt: "I switched to the Minimal Mistakes theme for a modern, clean look that gives the blog a fresh new appearance."

The old theme was the default jekyll theme. I wanted to change it to something more modern and clean. 

I chose the [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) theme. 

I like the clean look, I'm happy with the new theme and I think it gives the blog a fresh new look.
